2. `--name` optional, the process name for the fork mode.

Example:

```bash
$ pandora init ./app.js

❯ fork 
  cluster 
** The procfile.js was auto generated to location /xx/xx/procfile.js **
```
## start - Start an application at the background

```bash
pandora start [path] --name urAppName --env="NODE_ENV=production" --node-args="--expose-gc"
```

The often used command, to start an application at the background.

1. `[path]` Required, project directory, by default as the working directory.
2. `--name=urAppName` Optional, for specify the name of the application, by default as the name in package.json or last part of the working directory path.
3. `--env="NODE_ENV=production"` Optional, for specify the environmental variables, it can got by process.env.
4. `--node-args="--expose-gc"` Optional, for specify the Node.js execArgv.
4. `--args="--a=b"` Optional, for specify the args of the Node.js application.

Example:

```bash
# Working dir is  /home/admin/mytaobao/target/mytaobao ( suppose there is no name in package.json )

pandora start # Start application mytaobao, such as --name=mytaobao
pandora start . --name mytaobao # Same as above
pandora start `pwd` # Same as above
```

## stop - stop an application

> Notice: Only the application that start by start command can stop by this command

```bash
pandora stop [appName]
```
